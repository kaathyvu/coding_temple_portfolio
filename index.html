        <h1>From Veterinary Pharmacy to Programming</h1>
        <p>Hello, world! To introduce myself, my name is Kathy 
            Vu and I am an aspiring software developer. Before I got to this point,
            I was actually a Veterinary Pharmacist. I went to MCPHS University  
            for six years to get my PharmD., and then worked full-time as a
            Veterinary Pharmacist for another five years. Although my work was 
            very rewarding, I discovered I was never truly happy 
            with my career. I often felt like I was just going 
            through the motions and I mainly stayed with it because I was
            comfortable. However, in order to grow, I knew that I'd have to face 
            change and discomfort. When the pandemic initially hit, I took the 
            time to explore programming, and I taught myself some basic coding. 
            To my surprise, 
            I found myself actually enjoying it, which was a weird feeling 
            because I had never felt that with pharmacy. After a lot of support 
            and encouragement from my family and friends, I decided to leave the 
            pharmacy world and make a career change to programming. To say I'm 
            anxious is an understatement, however, I'm more excited to see this 
            next chapter in my life unfold.</p>
        <h1>Goals for 2022</h1>
        <p>My biggest goals for 2022 are to say yes to more things in life and to 
        get out of my comfort zone more often. I am someone who thrives on 
        daily routines and set schedules, but I am realizing that some of the 
        best adventures and memories of mine are the ones that are least expected. 
        I don't want to live a life filled with "could haves" or "should haves" 
        and the only way to do that is to try new things and to not be afraid to 
        face a little discomfort sometimes.</p>
